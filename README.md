## Golang's variation of Java Die Project

After learning Golang recently, I decided to write my first project using the Java Die assignment 
from my Applied Computing degree.
I followed the instruction from the Java assignment and adapted it.

### Project Description
A modular program for the definition and use of game dice. The program  
produces the results of each toss (two dices) and a total at the end. If the first toss 
generates a 5 and a 6, the next toss generates a 2 and a 1, the program should produce the total 
of each toss, and the grand total of tosses.
I limited the number of tosses to 3 in the program.
